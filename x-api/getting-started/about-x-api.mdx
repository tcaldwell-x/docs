title: "About the X API"
---

The X API can be used to programmatically retrieve and analyze X data, as well as build for the conversation on X.

Over the years, the X API has grown by adding additional levels of access for developers to be able to scale their access to enhance and research the public conversation.

Recently, we released the X API v2. The X API v2 includes a modern foundation, new and advanced features, and quick onboarding to [Basic access](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/products/basic).

The following three tabs explain the different versions and access levels of the X API, what’s new with v2, and which X resources you can retrieve, create, destroy, and adjust using the API.

    ## X API access levels and versions

    While the X API v2 is the primary X API, the platform currently supports previous versions (v1.1, Gnip 2.0) as well. We recommend that all users start with v2 as this is where all future innovation will happen.

    The **X API v2** includes a few access levels:

    |                               | Free                                                           | Basic                                                           | Pro                                                           | Enterprise                                                                                                  |

    ## What's new with v2

    The X API v2 represents the largest upgrade of the X API since 2012. With it comes a host of new and advanced features, as well as fast and free access to the API.

    Some of the features that are available with v2 include the following:

    ### New endpoints

    We have released a set of net-new endpoints to X API v2. You can see a full list of v2 endpoints, including those that are new, on our X API endpoint map guide.

    [Visit the X API endpoint map \>](/x-api/migrate/x-api-endpoint-map)

    ### New and more detailed data objects

    We've modernized our data objects with a variety off new improvements that will enable you to more easily navigate and parse data.

    [Visit the data dictionary \>](/x-api/fundamentals/data-dictionary)

    ### New parameters to help you retrieve just those objects and fields that you want

    We've added fields and expansions parameters to our data endpoints that allow you to request related objects and fields beyond those fields that return by default.

    [Learn how to use fields and expansions \>](/x-api/fundamentals/data-dictionary#how-to-use-fields-and-expansions)

    ### Advanced metrics

    More easily understand the performance of Posts, users, media, and polls from directly within your payload by requesting both public and private metrics including impressions, video views, user profile, and URL clicks, some of which are separated into an organic and promoted context.

    [Learn more about metrics \>](/x-api/fundamentals/metrics)

    ### Filter on and identify which Posts contain different topics

    When using search Posts or filtered stream, you can now filter by topic using our entity and context operators. We've also provided these topics within the Post payload to help with analysis.

    [Learn more about Post annotations \>](/x-api/fundamentals/post-annotations)

    ### Filter on and identify which Posts belong to a reply thread

    Make it easier to identify a Post as part of a conversation thread when using search Posts, filtered stream, and Post lookup. We've also added the ability to determine whether conversation reply settings have been set for a Post with the Post field `reply_settings`.

    ### And so much more...

    - High confidence spam filtering
    - Shortened URLs are fully unwound for easier URL analysis
    - Simplified JSON response objects by removing deprecated fields and modernizing labels
    - Recovery and redundancy functionality for our streaming endpoints

    - Streaming "rules" so you can make changes without dropping connections
    - More expressive query language for filtered stream and search
    - OpenAPI spec to build new libraries & more transparently track changes
    - API support for new features and endpoints more quickly as our platform evolves to meet the needs of developers, researchers, businesses, and people using X

  <Tab title="X API resources">
    ## X API platform resources

    In the API design space, a resource is an entity with associated data, relationships to other resources, and a set of methods that operate on it. For example, a Post is a resource that you can create, delete, or retrieve using a variety of different tools, such as historically searching for them, or retrieving them in real-time.

    The X API provides access to create, delete, receive, or adjust a variety of different resources on the platform including the following:

    | Resource            | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
